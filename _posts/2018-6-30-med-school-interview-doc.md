title: Medical School Interview Document
---

Applying to medical school can be divided into three big phases. The first is the high-school phase in which it is important to truly understand what medicine is all about, cultivate a love of scientific research, and take a plethora of AP courses to make college courses easier down the line. It is also very helpful to study as hard as possible on standardized exams and try to get into a top 20 US institution for undergrad. The second phase involves getting as high a GPA as possible in college, performing extracurriculars (both the cookie-cutter ones that all medical schools require, as well as ones you truly have a passion in). It is also the time to prepare for and ace the MCAT. The third phase is far more difficult than the other two. It is the process of writing the AMCAS primary application, completing school-specific secondary applications, and showing up to interviews.

As a pre-med chances are you've done fairly well in phase 1 and phase 2. Phase 3 however (unless you're a reapplicant) is a phase that departs drastically from the traditional "work hard, do well" mentality that has served you well in the first two phases. This phase is all about presenting your best self in front of actual human beings.

To help myself prepare for navigating these uncharted waters I have decided to mine resources on SDN, r/premed, and other places in order to create a nice Google Doc that summarized all this info. I'm hoping it will be a great cram sheet for interviews and such. Well, here it is in its current state.
