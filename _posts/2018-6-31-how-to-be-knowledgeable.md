title: How to be knowledgeable on things
---

One question I'm asked is what is the best way to prepare for an interview. Sure, there are common questions that you can rehearse so that you don't choke up mid-interview. But it is more important to have general knowledge on a wide variety of subjects. This is not only useful for interviews, but should help you strike up a conversation with anyone. Aside from that, it makes you seem relatively knowledgeable and well-read. In situations in which you need to assume leadership or gain trust, coming across as intelligent is to your advantage. 

There are several strategies I use to gain general knowledge, but they all revolve around one key thing: reading. It is important to read all the time. And no, I'm not going to give you that trash "read one book a day" advice that supposedly every successful CEO follows. Your time is precious and you should aim to absorb as much as you can in however much you read.

My personal reading list, especially as pre-med, is comprised of the following:

## New York Time Op-Eds
These are my favorite. They are ultra-liberal, but you shouldn't avoid reading something because it doesn't align with your views. You should read everything and pick apart everything. Perhaps a piece from this newspaper may just change your viewpoint or just sharpen your rebuttal skills. Regardless, op-eds are generally well-written and the ones from NYT will definitely expand your vocabulary. This can be very helpful for your own writing or for acing reading sections on standardized exams. I read at least 3 op-eds every day. 

## Wall Street Journal
If you're part of a certain industry or are vying for a position in said industry, the WSJ will provide you with the kind of incisive analysis that is bound to make you look knowledgable. As a pre-med, I primarily read things from the Healthcare business section of the site. It is especially useful to know what direction healthcare policy is heading it, what firms dominate the industry as well as the current state of regulation, and the current state of consumers. I try to read 3 articles from this journal.

Additionally, the WSJ is a more centrist/rightward publication so reading it alongside the NYT will help you discern both sides of an argument so you can rip apart a member of either side.

## The Atlantic, Slate, Medium, etc
These journals aren't as useful on a day to day use, but I like to think of them as readable documentaries. They're really fun and interesting to read, but chances are they won't always provide the kind of quick briefing you need.  

That's my reading list.
