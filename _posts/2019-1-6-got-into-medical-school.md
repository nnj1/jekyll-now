title: Got into Medical School
---

This post is a quick update. I have successfully secured a spot for the class of 2019 at my state medical school. This is relieving since I know I'll definitely be starting on my MD next year. Now I can spend the rest of my senior year relaxing (for the most part). I have yet to hear back from some of my top choices in March, and I'm still on the interview trail.

I have applied to a total of ~30 schools (primary application-wise) and completed around 27 applications completely. Of those 27, I was rejected from a couple of schools but have so far received a total of 6 interviews, which isn't too bad. I hope by the end of this cycle to maybe get 8 interviews.

Regardless, I have a good chunk of T20 interviews, and I hope that I hear some favorable news this March!

In a future post, I'll more about my stats and extracurriculars in hopes that it'll help someone out there who is reading this.
