My name is Newlyn Joseph, and I am currently a student at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. I attended Yale University for undergrad, where I studied Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (a mouthful which can be abbreviated to MB&B) and just regular old physics as well. I receieved a combined BS/MS in MB&B and a BS in physics. Now, I'm working towards an MD (and maybe an MPH).

I am a fairly active member of SDN and a lurker on r/medicalschool. You can also find me on Twitter and LinkedIn.

I am currently a medical student and researcher with a strong focus in molecular biophysics, computational biology, and medicine. I'm also interested in biotechnology and healthcare consulting. I also just ripped the last two sentences from my LinkedIn profile.

I like coding and programming too and for the longest time thought I would do CS. But I kinda got bored of it academically. I still love doing it as a hobby, with my favorite prototyping language being Python and my favorite big-boy language being C++. I love 3D programming, finite-state machines, and making physics engines. Though I'm probably not gonna have much time to do that once I start medical school.
