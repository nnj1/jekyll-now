My name is Newlyn Joseph and I am currently a student at Yale University. I study Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry (a mouthful which can be abbreviated to MB&B) and just regular old physics as well. I'm currently pursuing a combined BS/MS in MB&B and a BS in physics.

I've been pre-med for as long as I can remember and an active member of SDN and r/premed. I'm currently in the process of applying to medical school and I'll probably write a couple of blog posts about it.

I am currently a student and researcher with a strong focus in molecular biophysics, computational biology, and medicine. I'm also interested in biotechnology and healthcare consulting. I also just ripped the last two sentences from my LinkedIn profile.

I like coding and programming too and for the longest time thought I would do CS. But I kinda got bored of it academically. I still love doing it as a hobby, with my favorite prototyping language being Python and my favorite big-boy language being C++. I love 3D programming, finite-state machines, and making physics engines. Though I'm probably not gonna have much time to do that once I start medical school. 

### More Information

Feel free to contact me for a resume or if you'd just like to chat. I'm working to put my CV up on here soon.
